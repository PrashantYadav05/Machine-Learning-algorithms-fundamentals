# Machine Learning algorithms fundamentals
## Understand Data with "Descriptive Statistics":
* Review the dimensions of your dataset.
* Review the data types of attributes in your data.
* Summarize the distribution of instances across classes in your dataset.
* Summarize your data using descriptive statistics.
* Understand the relationships in your data using correlations.
* Review the skew of the distributions of each attribute.

## Understand Data With Visualization:
* Histograms.
* Density Plots.
* Box and Whisker Plots.
* Correlation Matrix Plot.
* Scatter Plot Matrix.

## "Feature Scaling" for Machine Learning:
* Rescale data.
* Standardize data.
* Normalize data.
* Binarize data.

## "Feature Selection" for Machine Learning:
* Univariate Selection.
* Recursive Feature Elimination.
* Principle Component Analysis.
* Feature Importance.

## Evaluate the performance of Machine Learning algorithms with Resampling:
* Train and Test Sets (Model learning capacity decreses)
* k-fold Cross Validation (Each sample gets included in test, Model variance of accuracy will come down, Ratio of classification data may not be maintained)
* Leave One Out Cross Validation (Model may have high variance, High computation time)
* Bootstrap or Repeated Random Test-Train Splits.
Note: Caution while applying these validation techniques in Time Series data.

## Machine Learning algorithm "Performance Metrics":
* Classification Metrics
  * Classification Accuracy.
  * Logarithmic Loss.
  * Area Under ROC Curve.
  * Confusion Matrix.
  * Classification Report.
* Regression Metrics
